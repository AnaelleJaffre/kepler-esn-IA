    "# Hyperparameter Tuning for ESN on Kepler Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first experiment with a small Echo State Network (ESN) on the Kepler labelled dataset, the results showed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy:** 99%\n",
    "- **AUC:** 0.7\n",
    "- **Errors:** 5 out of 570  \n",
    "\n",
    "At first sight, this seems excellent. However, **all errors correspond to stars that actually have exoplanets**, which means the model **never detected any exoplanet**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** The ESN is biased toward the majority class (no exoplanet) due to the extreme class imbalance in the dataset. The goal of this notebook is to **fine-tune the ESN hyperparameters** to improve detection of exoplanets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Initial Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the base parameters used previously:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "units = 20          # number of neurons in the reservoir\n",
    "leak_rate = 0.3     # leak rate (memory retention of neurons)\n",
    "input_scaling = 0.5 # influence of input on the reservoir\n",
    "spectral_radius = 0.9 # strength of reservoir dynamics\n",
    "ridge = 1e-6        # regularization\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Parameters to Optimize\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the tutorial and our observations, we can focus on the following hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``units`` = Number of neurons in the reservoir, from 20 to 200\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``leak_rate`` = Memory of the reservoir, from 0.1 to 1\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``input_scaling`` = Influence of input on reservoir, from 0.1 to 1\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``spectral_radius`` = Strength of dynamics, from 0.5 to 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``ridge`` = Regularization (ridge), from 1e-8 to 1e-2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** increase the network's ability to detect the minority class (exoplanets) without destabilizing the reservoir.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fix the random seed to ensure reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Normalize each series individually (mean 0, std 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Define a grid or random search over the above hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For each configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Train the ESN\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Compute the AUC\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Select hyperparameters that maximize AUC (more informative than accuracy due to imbalance) and minimize the number of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Load Dataset and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "This part is similar to the loading made in the base experiment."

    "## 6. Hyperparameter Fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the ESN is all set up, we can start the fine-tuning experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology \n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology we propose here is inspired by the paper *[Which Hype for my New Task? Hints and Random Search for Echo State Networks Hyperparameters](https://inria.hal.science/hal-03203318v2/document)*, published in 2021 by Xavier Hinaut and Nathan Trouvain. In this paper, the authors suggest that random search is more efficient than grid search for ESN hyperparameters optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in the following steps, we will finetune hyperparameters thanks to a random search, instead of a grid search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why random search?\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper written by Xavier Hinaut and Nathan Trouvain explains that in a grid search, evaluations can be wasted in **low-impact regions**. Indeed, in reservoir computing, overall performance on hyperparameters is rather **non-linear and irregular**. There are a lot of chance that gird-search only sees low-impact regions because of these non-lineariries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of random search is that it **samples uniformly** across the full range of each parameter. Hence, it covers more independent combinations and is more likely to find effective configurations with **fewer trials**. Because only a few hyperparameters strongly influence performance, random search spreads the search more efficiently in order to explore these influential directions. This approach reduces the redundancy inherent in grids and achieves better performance for equivalent search conditions.\n"
